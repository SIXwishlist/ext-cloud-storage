[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/plesk/ext-cloud-storage.svg)](https://gitter.im/plesk/ext-cloud-storage?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This Plesk extension allows to integrate Cloud Storage solutions to user's webspace with a "cloud disk" like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc. Additionally, the extension should be integrated with Auth mechanisms. If a user is already logged in he can easily link his webspace/s with his Cloud disks.
